## About

This is a simple discord bot made in python 3.8 to help developers with your own **MU Server** exclusive functions without use sites or other softwares. I create this for use with my friends in a custom private server for **MU Online MMORPG**. with this my friends and I can use commands like **!ranking** and **!pk** to see our progress without any other dependencies and we can use only discord to interact with the server.

This is a simple version, you can customize and modify wehatever you want. Any questions let me know and follow my youtube channel and discord and if you want to play with us send me a message, we have a classic MU Server version 1.0M+ (GMO Client) **Old but gold!**

Thanks for use my code. :D
